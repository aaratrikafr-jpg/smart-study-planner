📘 Smart Study Planner

Smart Study Planner is a web-based productivity application built using Python and Streamlit that helps students plan their daily study routine in a more personalized and consistent way.

The app generates study plans based on user inputs such as available study time, subjects, priorities, and mood, while also tracking consistency through a study streak system.
